There you can see two options of work the first where you dont have limitations to scroll up and down and edit the number of the both imputs:

and the second where te inputs are disabled also the steps that you can do are limited by presets that where arrive from API :

For this solution I did a webpack configuration manual.

Also added routes for the navigation and return back to init

# [Future Improvements]

  The next steps that I could make will be a list of items that are between this prices.
  Maybe the user can set the min and max in a settings component to filter in both exercises.
